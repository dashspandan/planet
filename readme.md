The popsyn.py file is the main file.

To run simulations: 

1. Edit the name of the text file in buildplanet4.py. This is the file that will have all planetary system information after simulations.
2. Run the popsyn.py file after changing any input parameters you need to.

buildplanet4.py, nextorbit.py and coeffstandard.py are function files used to simulate the planetary systems.

Some python files are provided for plotting the data e.g. newplots1.py. The main popsyn.py file itself can be modified for planet profile simulations.

The statistics.py file provides the percent wise distribution of planetary systems by number of planets assuming the total number of simulations is 1000. If this number is changed, tweak the file accordingly. disks.py plots the different disk mass distributions provided in the paper.

diskplanetcomp.py is teh file that outputs Figure 1 in the paper.
